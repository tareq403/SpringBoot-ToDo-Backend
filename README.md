# SpringBoot ToDo Backend
This is a simple project demonstrate how to prepare a RESTful CRUD backend server
with SpringBoot framework. In this project, we prepare a simple **_Todo_** model with
few fields and expose API for read all instances, read single instance by _id_,
create a new instance, update an instance by _id_ and deleting an instance by _id_.

We have allowed CORS to accept API requests from different origin, which is useful
for the [frontend project](https://github.com/tareq403/VueJS-ToDo-Frontend).

We have used [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database of this project.
